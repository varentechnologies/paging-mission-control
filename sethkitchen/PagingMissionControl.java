* VERSION: 1
* HOME URL: https://github.com/SethKitchen/paging-mission-control
* KNOWN BUGS: none
*
* SYNOPSIS: Uses HashMap/Queue combination to efficiently keep track of satellites and timeframes
* while telemetry data comes in. Alerts when sensor reading is over threshold 3 times in 5 minutes.
*
* DESCRIPTION: You are tasked with assisting satellite ground operations for an earth science mission
* that monitors magnetic field variations at the Earth's poles. A pair of satellites fly in tandem orbit
* such that at least one will have line of sight with a pole to take accurate readings. The satelliteâ€™s
* science instruments are sensitive to changes in temperature and must be monitored closely.
* Onboard thermostats take several temperature readings every minute to ensure that the precision 
* magnetometers do not overheat. Battery systems voltage levels are also monitored to ensure that power is
* available to cooling coils. Design a monitoring and alert application that processes status telemetry from
* the satellites and generates alert messages in cases of certain limit violation scenarios.
* 
* If for the same satellite there are three battery voltage readings that are under the red low limit within
* a five minute interval.
*
* If for the same satellite there are three thermostat readings that exceed the red high limit within a five
* minute interval.
